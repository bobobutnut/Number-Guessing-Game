	<h2 class="text">Joy and Bing Bong are trapped together in the Memory Dump, the only way they can escape is to power the old wagon by guessing the correct password!

You only have 10 guesses and limited time (you will be alerted every 10 seconds).

If you can't guess the correct password by then, the wagon will be broken, and you will be trapped here forever!
Enter your guess carefully:
(Hint: The password is a number between 1 and 100.)</h2>
